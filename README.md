# Pilotable-Injuries
Lets pilots pilot even with injuries...as long as you got the Medtechs to do so.

For every 3 MedTech points you have, pilots can ignore an injury when the game decides whether they can pilot or not.

# Installation Instructions

1. Install the Battletech Mod Loader if you don't have it yet. Can be found here: https://github.com/Mpstark/BattleTechModLoader/releases/tag/v0.1-alpha

2. Download latest release.

3. Put .dll in `BATTLETECH\Mods`. Make the `Mods` folder if it doesn't exist yet.
